# JAX Basics

A personal learning repository for exploring the JAX framework.

## About

This repository contains code examples and experiments as I learn JAX - a Python library for high-performance numerical computing and automatic differentiation.

## Topics Covered

- Basic JAX operations
- Automatic differentiation with `grad`
- Just-in-time compilation with `jit`
- Vectorization with `vmap`
- Neural network implementations
- GPU/TPU acceleration

## Setup

```bash
pip install jax jaxlib
```

For GPU support:
```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]"
```
